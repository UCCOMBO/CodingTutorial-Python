This includes functions we have discussed earlier such as `print()`. There are many more functions that have been developed by the software engineers who created python, but frequently, these do not come pre-loaded into your python environment. Instead, you can install these from the web as you need them, and then load them into your python scripts in order to use them within your code.\n","\n","\n","## <font color = \"orange\">  What is pandas?\n","\n","A huge part of any data analysis pipeline is getting your data formatted in a way that is usable for the rest of analysis. This might mean filtering the data, fixing typos, normalizing the values, or any number of things! Typically, there is some amount of work that has to be done in order to use a simple spreadsheet for more complicated data analysis.\n","\n","The pandas module was developed to help python programmers work with their data more efficiently. It allows you to more easily manipulate your data spreadsheet into your desired format.\n","\n","To get started, we need to import the pandas module."],"metadata":{"id":"CTHBx1VA1828"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd"],"metadata":{"id":"WBWXMvbMD7wf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## <font color = \"orange\"> Investigate data contents"],"metadata":{"id":"r-IN7xxt95do"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We can use pandas to get a quick idea of what kind of data is available.
